# Tenzies 🎲

A web-based dice game built with React + Vite. The goal: roll ten dice, lock or “hold” any dice you want, and keep rolling until **all ten show the same number**.  

## 🚀 What is Tenzies

Tenzies is a simple but addictive dice game, perfect for practicing React fundamentals and UI logic. Players roll dice, choose which dice to “hold”, and try to get all dice to match. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

## 🎯 How to Play

1. Roll all 10 dice.  
2. Click on any dice to “hold” — those held dice won’t roll again.  
3. Keep rolling the unheld dice.  
4. The game ends when **all dice show the same face** (e.g. all “6”).  
5. Optionally track number of rolls and time taken to challenge yourself. Many React-based versions use roll counter and timer features. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
